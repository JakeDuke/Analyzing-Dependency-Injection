## Apps

This folder only contains three apps.  It's a basic browser app with an HTML file that requires some JS and runs them when the Window loads:
* [Dom-Console-Node](./MVC_list.md)

---

## Install Instructions

Clone the code to your computer.  That's all.  No installing or building necessary.

## File Structure

Nothing remarkable here, just a single folder with all of the files at the top level. 

index.html_ is the entry point.  App.js requires all of the other files and builds them together when the Window Object is done loading.
